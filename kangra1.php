		<h3>From the time of Raju Maru, 67 Rajas of this dynasty ruled over Chamba until it finally merged with the Indian Union
		in April 1948, although Chamba was under British suzerainty from 1846 to this time.[2]
The town has numerous temples and palaces,[3][4] and hosts two popular jatras (fairs), the "Suhi Mata Mela" and the
 "Minjar Mela", which last for several days of music and dancing. Chamba is also well noted for its arts and crafts, 
 particularly its Pahari paintings, which originated in the Hill Kingdoms of North India between the 17th and 19th century, 
 and its handicrafts and textiles</h3><br>
