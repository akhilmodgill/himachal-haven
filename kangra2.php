		<h2>Kangra is known for having the oldest serving Royal Dynasty in the world, the Katoch.[citation needed] In 1758, Raja Ghamand Chand
		was appointed nazim or governor of Jullundur Doab under the Afghans. Ghamand Chand was a brave and strong ruler who restored 
		the prestige of Kangra. As he was unable to capture Kangra fort, he built another fort at Tira Sujanpur on the left bank of the Beas,
		almost opposite to Alampur on a hill overlooking the town. He died in 1774 and was succeeded by his son, Tegh Chand, who died
		too soon in 1775.</h2><br>
