		<h2>Generally, people have the pucca houses in the district. This is primarily because stone is available in abundance. Besides this, slates for roofs are also available in nearby quarries
		in the adjoining districts. People, indeed, have developed a taste for modern houses and the traditional stones are getting replaced by bricks, corrugated sheets and marvel. About 92% population 
		of this district lives in the Rural areas and they are agriculturist.</h2><br>

		<h2>Nestled in the northern region of Chhattisgarh, Bilaspur is the second-largest city in the state. Wel
		-known for its abundance of coal, Bilaspur is also famous for its aromatic rice called 'Doobraj Rice,'
		and textiles such as Tussar silk, cotton clothes, and handloom-weaved Kosa silk saris. The varied 
		and vibrant culture of Bilaspur adds many colors to the otherwise monochromatic city of coal mines.
		Bilaspur's rich heritage of archaeological sites and temples such as Pataleshwar temple, Devri temple,
		Dindeshwari temple in Malhar and Ratanpur, where one can also find ruins of ancient forts, attracts 
		pilgrims to this area </h2><br>
