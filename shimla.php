		<h2>Shimla is the capital and the largest city of the northern Indian state of
	Himachal Pradesh. Shimla is also a district which is bounded by Mandi and Kullu in the north, Kinnaur in the east, the state of
	Uttarakhand in the south-east, and Solan and Sirmaur. In 1864, Shimla was declared as the summer capital of British India,
	succeeding Murree, northeast of Rawalpindi. After independence, the city became the capital of Punjab and was later named 
	the capital of Himachal Pradesh. It is the principal commercial, cultural and educational centre of the state.</h2><br>

		as well as multiple temples and churches. The colonial architecture and churches, the temples and the natural environment of the 
		city attracts tourists. Attractions include the Viceroy Lodge, the Christ Church, the Jakhoo Temple, the Mall Road and the Ridge,
		which together form the city centre. The Kalkaâ€“Shimla Railway line built by the British, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is also a 
		major tourist attraction. Owing to its steep terrain, Shimla hosts the mountain biking race MTB Himalaya, which started in 2005
		and is regarded as the biggest event of its kind in South Asia. Shimla also has the largest natural ice skating rink in South Asia.
