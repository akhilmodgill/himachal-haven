		<h2>Mandi is revered by people of Sikh, Hindu and Buddhist community. Mandi is a beautiful yet an unusual destination of
		Himachal Pradesh. The town curls around the holy Rewalsar Lake which is said to have appeared when the king of Mandi
		tried to kill Guru Padmasambhava when he got to know that his daughter Mandarava is running off with him. On the bank
		of the lake is the 12 m-high statue of Padmasambhava, which is the main attraction of the place. </h2><br>
