		<h3>Till 19th century, Tourism in Himachal Pradesh was restricted only to a limited movement of pilgrims
		to a few spiritual destinations in around the hills.Only when the British established their chain of hill
		stations did tourism receive recognition in the State. Tourism activity received a shot in the arm when 
		British declared Shimla. The Summer Capital of India  in 1864. Post independence, more investment
		in the infrastructure sector led to opening up of Tourism in the State. However the biggest boost
		to tourism occurred in the mid 80s and 90s.</h3>

		<h3>While traditionally Himachal was known as a summer destination, the Department of Tourism & Civil
		Aviation has taken special efforts to break the seasonality factor and has developed diversified
		tourism products to attract tourists in other seasons too. Now Himachal is known as A Destination
		for All Seasons and All Reasons. In fact, the Department has laid a special emphasis on the
		development of activity-based tourism and opening up of new sub destinations. To promote tourism in
		the countryside and to unexplored areas, appropriate infrastructure is being developed within
		available resources. By focussing on quality tourists, the Department aims at promoting sustainable
		tourism and encouraging private sector to develop tourism related infrastructure in the State without
		disturbing the existing ecology and environment</h3>
