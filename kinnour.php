		<h2>According to Punjab states Gazetteer-Shimla hill States from 1803 to 1815 the earstwhile states of 
		Bushahr faced the menace of Gurkha invasions. Immediate after the death of Raja Kehri Singh,
		The Gurkhas made massive attack on Bushahr. The minor ruler and his mother who could not withstand 
		the attack fled away to Namru leaving behind a rich treasury at Sarahan. The Gurkhas looted the 
		treasury and completely destroyed the records of the state. Keeping Gurkhas of Nepal had extended
		their dominions greatly during the end of the eighteen century. Amar Singh Thapa, the Gurkha leader 
		went up to kangra valley. He was drawn from the valley by the superior forces of Ranjit Singh 
		and those of raja Sansar Chand of Kangra. The tract between theSatluj and Jamuna came under British
		protection by the treaty of 1809 between Ranjit Singh and the British Govt.</h2><br>

		<h2>In fact then Chini tehsil covered the entire Kinnaur valley beyond Wangtu which was created in 1891
		by the then ruler Tika Raghunath Singh. Thus 1891 onwards Chinni tehsil continued to be in existence
		with its vast area beyond Wangtu uptill 1960. Since 1947 it was a tehsil of the then Mahasu district. By 
		1960 the importance of reorganising border area was realised and consequently in view of ethnic and
		cultural considerations the areas which were partly in Rampur tehsil were reorganised into a separate 
		District forming the present Kinnaur district.</h2><br>
